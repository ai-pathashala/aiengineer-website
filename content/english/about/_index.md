The idea of writing and publishing content on the subject of AI engineering emerged when I started my role as an architect in the AI Solutions Engineering team at Dell Technologies. I started reading and learning about different aspects of Generative AI technologies. I was reading books, watching videos, and experimenting with a few frameworks for AI model development, serving, fine-tuning, and AI application development. It was a lot of ad-hoc learning. These frameworks and any related AI technologies are rapidly evolving. What you learned last month may not be relevant or may be outdated next month. I shifted my focus to strengthen the fundamental concepts and frameworks are just a way to realize these foundational concepts. This helped me accelerate my learning. 

[ai-engineer.in](https://ai-engineer.in) aims to provide educational content for both aspiring and experienced AI engineers. This includes a range of topics across different aspects of AI Engineering. As a community, we should learn from one another and share our knowledge with others. We do not intend to put this content behind a paywall. Don't hesitate to reach out if you are interested in contributing content to this site.
